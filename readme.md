3. Headless Vulkan Application:

vk-gl4es (or similar):
Use a pre-built example like vk-gl4es (which uses Vulkan to emulate OpenGL) or create your own custom Vulkan application designed for off-screen rendering.

Custom Application:
If you're building your own, ensure your Vulkan code creates a surface using the VK_KHR_xlib_surface or VK_KHR_wayland_surface extensions, depending on your setup (X11 or Wayland).

Offscreen Rendering:
Configure your Vulkan application to render to a texture or framebuffer object (FBO) instead of a window displayed on the screen.

Example (Custom):
You'll need to create a VkInstance, find a physical device, create a logical device, and then create a swapchain or image for rendering. This often involves using the VK_KHR_surface extension and then the platform-specific surface extension (e.g., VK_KHR_xlib_surface for X11 or VK_KHR_wayland_surface for Wayland).
